      </div>
      <div id="tribute-info-essay" class="center">
        <h3><u>Background</u></h3>
        <p>
          For decades now, Hollywood traditions have defined the making of
          films, but there have been many creative directors who have
          transcended the rigidities and made filmmaking an international
          phenomenon. One such director was late Satyajit Ray.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Satyajit Ray</b> was born on May 2, 1921, in an intellectual and
          affluent family in Calcutta, India. His grandfather was a
          distinguished writer, painter, a violin player and a composer. His
          father, Sukumar Ray was also an eminent poet, writer and illustrator
          in the tradition of Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear. While still at
          school and college, Ray became a fan of western film and classical
          music. He studied art at Santiniketan.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ray was a prolific writer, and the strength and distinction of his
          films derive from the screenplays he wrote himself. He had a
          reputation for being ingenuously creative within the limitations of
          modest budgets and scant equipments.
        </p>
        <p>
          His films are a rare blend of intellect and emotions. There is a
          precise studied control in his films, yet he succeeds in evoking deep
          emotional responses from his audience. Despite the acute sensitivity
          of his films, there is a noticeable lack of melodrama.
        </p>
        <h3><u>Cinematography</u></h3>
        <p>
          From 1962 onwards, he composed the music for all his films, and
          designed the publicity posters for his new releases. Satyajit Ray's
          films are cinematic and literary at the same time; using a simple
          narrative, usually in a classical format, but greatly detailed and
          operating at many levels of interpretation.
          <b
            >His first film, Father Panchali established him as a major film
            director, winning awards - Best Human Document, Cannes, 1956 and
            Best Film, Vancouver, 1958.</b
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          His later films include Devi (The Goddess, 1960), TeenKanya (Three
          Daughters, 1961), Charulata (The Lonely Wife, 1964), Nayak (The Hero,
          1966), AsaniSmht (Distant Thunder, 1973), Shatranj Ke Khilari (The
          Chess Players, 1977), Ghare Baire (The Home and the World, 1984),
          Ganasbatru (An Enemy Of The People, 1989) and Sbakba Prashakha
          (Branches Of The Tree, 1991). Acjantuk (The Stranger, 1991) was his
          last film.
        </p>
        <p>
          While shooting, Ghare-Baire (Home and the World) in 1984, he suffered
          two heart attacks and his son, Sandip Ray, completed the project. Ill
          health kept Satyajit Ray away from active filmmaking for about four
          years. In 1989, he resumed taking films with Ganaslmti-u (Enemy of the
          People, 1989).
        </p>
        <h3><u>Awards</u></h3>
        <p>
          Many film critics and film historians found these films a marked
          departure from his earlier work.
          <b
            >In 1992, he accepted a Lifetime Achievement Oscar from his sickbed
            in Calcutta through a special live satellite-television event and
            Bharat Kama (the Jewel, the ultimate honour from India.</b
          >
          Apart from that he also won other prestigious award like Dada Saheb
          Phalke(1985), Padma Shree (1958) and Filmfare (1978).

        <h3><u>Quotes about Satyajit Ray</u></h3>
        <p>
          <i>
            “The quiet but deep observation, understanding and love of the human
            race, which are characteristic of all his [Ray’s] films, have
            impressed me greatly…Not to have seen the cinema of Ray means
            existing in the world without seeing the sun or the moon.” </i

            >“Whenever someone speaks from Kolkata, I remember Satyajit Ray's
            call, praising me for ‘Godfather I’.....We know of Indian cinema
            through Ray’s works and, to me, his best is ‘Devi’, a cinematic
            milestone.” </i
